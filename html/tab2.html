<h2>Emission spectra</h2>
<h3>What is?</h3>
<p>
  is defined as the set of wavelengths emitted by an atom that is in an excited
  state. in an excited state. When emitting electromagnetic radiation, the
  exited atom is atom passes to a lower energetic state.
</p>
<h3>what does it mean?</h3>
<p>
  Band emission spectra are produced by molecules that emit radiation in clusters of closely spaced lines that merge to
  radiation in clusters of closely spaced lines that merge to form bands.
  form bands. These emission spectra contain much useful information about the structure and composition of matter.
  about the structure and composition of matter.
</p>
<h3>What does it have to do with the electromagnetic spectrum?</h3>
<p>
  When we talk about the electromagnetic spectrum of an object, we refer to the different wavelengths
  wavelengths that it emits (called emission spectrum) or absorbs (called absorption spectrum), thus
  absorbs (called absorption spectrum), thus generating a distribution of energy as a set of electromagnetic waves.

</p>

<h3>What does it have to do with chemistry?</h3>
<p>
  each element in the periodic table has a unique emission spectrum known as a spectral signature.
  known as a spectral signature, so that by analyzing the emission spectrum of a substance we can
  a substance we can identify the elements that compose it.
  <br />
  <br />
  This procedure is called emission spectroscopy and is a very useful tool in various fields of science.

<h4>Methane</h4>
<p>
  El espectro del metano está compuesto por dos fuertes bandas, o grupos de
  líneas de absorción, centradas en 3.3 µm (ν3) y 7.6 µm (ν4). La banda más
  fuerte del metano por debajo de las 2µm es la denominada 2ν3, cuyo centro está
  localizado en 1.665 µm.
